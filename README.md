OAI-PMH Harvester (plugin for Omeka)
====================================

[OAI-PMH Harvester] is a plugin for [Omeka S] that allows to import records from
OAI-PMH data providers.

Some online repositories expose their metadata through the [Open Archives
Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting] (OAI-PMH). This plugin makes it
possible to harvest that metadata, mapping it to the Omeka data model. The
plugin can be used for one-time data transfers, or to keep up-to-date with
changes to an online repository.

Currently the plugin is able to import [Dublin Core], and [METS] if the profile
uses Dublin Core.

* Dublin Core is an internationally recognized standard for describing any
  resource. Every OAI-PMH data provider should implement this standard.
* METS is the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard and is mainly designed
  for digitalized items, as books, journals, manuscripts, video and audio.

This is a simplified version of the [plugin] for [Omeka Classic], which was
shamelessly copied whenever possible. The work consisted mainly in adapting the
code to Omeka-S - *i.e* Zend Framework 3.

Unlike the Omeka Classic version, [CDWA Lite] is not yet supported, and some
other features, in particular updating.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename module folder `OaiPmhRepository`.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module] and follow the
config instructions.


Instructions
------------

### Performing a harvest

* Go to the Oai-Pmh Harvester page.
* Type or paste the address of the repository you want to fetch data from
  (usually something like *http://sample-host.org/data/oai*)
* Cilck the **View Sets** button.
* Choose the sets you want to harvest by checking the box **Harvest this set ?**
  for each set you want to be harvested.
* Choose the protocol you want to use : **oai_dc** or **oai_dcterms** or
  **mets** for each set.
* Click the **Harvest** button.
* A task should be created. The module creates a collection for each fetched set
  and then proceeds to harvest the content.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------
